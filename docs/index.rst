Welcome!
================================
Welcome to the documentation for **ralf**, the base library within the larger
RALF Ecosystem. Here you will find documentation
and tutorials that will help you get started with building applications using Large
Language Models (LLMs).

.. note::
   This project is still under active development. If you find a bug or want to 
   suggest a change, please create a Github issue or email ralf@jhuapl.edu. 
   Also, if youâ€™re interested in contributing to the project, let us know! We are 
   eager to see the project grow if the community finds it useful.

About
=====


**ralf** is a Python library intended to assist developers in creating applications
that involve calls to LLMs. A core concept in **ralf** is the idea of *composability*,
which allows chaining together LLM calls such that the output of one call can be
used to form the prompt of another. **ralf** makes it easy to chain together both
LLM-based and Python-based actions-- enabling developers to construct complex 
information processing pipelines composed of simpler building blocks. Using LLMs
in this way can lead to more capable, robust, steerable and inspectable applications.

Currently, the **ralf** base library offers generic functionality for action chaining
(through the ``Dispatcher`` and ``Action`` classes) as well as text classificaiton
(through the ``ZeroShotClassifier`` class). Check out the other projects within
the RALF ecosystem for more specialized functionality, like dialogue management 
and information extraction.
